aoc 2021


To run the code, enter the repl and do the following

- First activate the package
  - For testing: type test in the package manager to run the local test examples.
  - For getting the actual results: type `using aoc;open(aoc.day7.part1, "input/day7.txt")` in the repl.
  - - Alternatively, you can do `using aoc;open(f->aoc.day11.part1(f, 100), "input/day11.txt")`
## side notes
My code does indents by 4, it's github's fault.
